						Try replacing incandescent bulbs in your home with CFL bulbs. CFL bulbs cost more upfront but 
						last 12 times longer than regular incandescent bulbs.

						Use Energy Efficient Appliances
					</p>
					<p class="item-text">
						When planning to buy some electrical appliances, prefer to buy one with Energy Star rating. 
						Energy-efficient appliances with Energy Star rating consume less energy and save you money. 
						They might cost you more in the beginning, but it is much more of an investment for you.

						Energy from the sun
					</p>
					<p class="item-text">
						The sun has produced energy for billions of years and is the ultimate source for all of the 
						energy sources and fuels that we use today. People have used the sun's rays (solar radiation) 
						for thousands of years for warmth and to dry meat, fruit, and grains. Over time, people 
						developed technologies to collect solar energy for heat and to convert it into electricity.

						What is geothermal energy?
					</p>
					<p class="item-text">
						Geothermal energy is heat within the earth. The word geothermal comes from the Greek words geo 
						(earth) and therme (heat). Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because heat is 
						continuously produced inside the earth. 
						People use geothermal heat for bathing, to heat buildings, and to generate electricity.

						Energy from moving air
					</p>
					<p class="item-text">
						Wind is caused by uneven heating of the earth's surface by the sun. 
						Because the earth's surface is made up of different types of land and water, 
						it absorbs the sun's heat at different rates. 
						One example of this uneven heating is the daily wind cycle.

						Biomass—renewable energy from plants and animals
					</p>
					<p class="item-text">
						Biomass is renewable organic material that comes from plants and animals. 
						Biomass was the largest source of total annual U.S. energy consumption until the mid-1800s. 
						Biomass continues to be an important fuel in many countries, especially for cooking and heating in 
						developing countries.

						Hydropower is energy in moving water
					</p>
					<p class="item-text">
						People have a long history of using the force of water flowing in streams and rivers to produce mechanical 
						energy. Hydropower was one of the first sources of energy used for electricity generation, and until 2019, 
						hydropower was the largest source of total annual U.S. renewable electricity generation.
